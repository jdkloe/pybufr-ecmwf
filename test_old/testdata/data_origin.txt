The testfiles provided in this directory are intended only for
testing the pybufr-ecmwf module. They data should not be used
for other purposes.

The origin of these files is as follows:

==>ISXH58EUSR199812162225.
ERS2 scatterometer BUFR file
taken from the ERS2 data stream recieved at KNMI from ESA.
(see our local mos archive, file:
 /obsrs/sat/ers/scat/esa/1998/Global_ERS_Backup_19981216.tar.gz)
See also: http://www.knmi.nl/scatterometer/ers_prod/

==>Testfile.BUFR
constructed from ISXH58EUSR199812162225
by:  padding it with 2 zero bytes
and: loading it in Fortran and writing it back to BUFR again
(this explains a minor rounding difference in the direction column)

==>Testfile3CorruptedMsgs.BUFR
this file was manually constructed by glueing 3 copies of the 
file Testfile.BUFR together, followd by some manual editing to
deliberately create a corrupted file.
